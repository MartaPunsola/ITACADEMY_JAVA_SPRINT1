Instructions:

1. Open your computer's terminal (CMD).

2. Write "cd" followed by the path of the directory where your file is located. 
For example: cd "C:\Users\Marta Punsola\eclipse-workspace\TascaS1_05\src"

3. First, you will need to compile the file you want to execute. Write "javac" followed by the name of the package and the name and extension of the file.
For example: javac n1exercici3/Main_n1exercici3.java

4. Then, execute the file writing "java" followed by the name of the package, the name of the file (without the extension) and the name of the package.
For example: java n1exercici3/Main_n1exercici3 n1exercici3

The program will recursively list the files of the directory and save the results to a .txt file named DirectoryTree.
